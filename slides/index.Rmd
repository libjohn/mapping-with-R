## **Git** is a *Version Control System*

Versioning can be used as a kind of breadcrumb system that helps track the research process.  Using version control, one can easily "roll back" to an earlier moment in the research workflow.

### Source Code Mangement
By this I simply mean version control on a personal level.  Once can "branch" stages of research and merge successfull operations.  In this way it becomes easier to keep track of the process and the progress.

### Tracking changes in **any file set**

Git can be used to track any files.

## Social **git Repositories**

???

Social Coding = collaboration

Introduce the idea of LOCKSS: "Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe."  Now you have copies in the cloud and on local workstations.  You can work in various locations on various computers (e.g. at home and at work) without worrying about version or file location.

Share trackable progress of your reproducible activity -- even if you are only sharing with yourself until you "publish".

- Git is not GitHub

- GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket are all "Public Hubs" which work with Git versioning.

Effective collaboration extends the diversity of input and feedback available to you.

## Duke's GitLab

[gitlab.oit.duke.edu](http://gitlab.oit.duke.edu)

???

- Duke has it's own instance of GitLab

Duke's GitLab instance means you don't have to pay and can still synchronize to larger networks (e.g. GitHub) at any point.

I use it mostly for private work and development.  I like my public presence at GitHub.  Both can be accessed via RStudio.

    
Public Hubs are defined as GitHub, BitBucket, and the public GitLab.

## Markdown

???

R Markdown -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system.  Thus R Notebooks become "literate code" where reports are an outcome of analysis.  If analysis changes at "run-time" reports can change as integrated parts of the whole.  

Notably:  **You Don't have to be a coder** to benefit from Version Control and R Markdown.  The two method/features can be used to compose all of your reporting needs, including MS Word, PDF, LaTex, WebPages, WebSites, Slides, e-books, etc.

I want to emphasize that *R* and *Git* are ideal for *reproducible research*.  However, the added factor of **R Markdown** -- when combined with various R packages -- makes R a flexible report generation system arguably more *open* and *reproducible* than other proprietary collaborations systems.

## **Reproducible Research** 

Integrate your reproducible workflow using *Literate Coding* practices in *R* then generate reports directly from analysis 

### R Notebooks + R Markdown + Git

???

This is where **Open** becomes **Awesome**

## Rstudio & Git

---

## Orchestrating with RStudio

- Masks the CLI

- Easier to get started

- Power Users can still use commands
