## Overview

These learning and quick-reference resource pages support the face-to-face workshop, [Mapping with R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/mapping_workshop/), offered via the [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data/), Duke University Libraries. The exercises and workshop are designed to help you learn georeferencing, make a  [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) with USA census data via the [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) package, and briefly introduce the [sf](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package, simple features.
