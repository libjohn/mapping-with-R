[Guide to geospatial applications using the R programming language](https://guides.library.duke.edu/r-geospatial)

[Code for Hands-on Workshop -- Spring 2019](https://github.com/libjohn/map-spring2019)

## Overview

These learning and quick-reference resource pages support the face-to-face workshop, [Mapping with R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/mapping_workshop/), offered via the [Data & Visualization Services](https://library.duke.edu/data/) Department, Duke University Libraries. The exercises and workshop are designed to help you learn georeferencing, make a  [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) with USA census data via the [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) package, and briefly introducing the [sf](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package, simple features.

During the Workshop we introduce

- Georeferencing latitude and longitude
- Choropleths
- Polygons (shapes)
- Census Geography
- Briefly introduce ACS and Decennial census

    - Census API keys 
    
- Thematic mapping using _Simple Features for R_

## Workshop Resource Page

1. Georeferencing, Plotting XY latitude & longitude: with [interactive `mapview` maps](01_georeference.html) and saving static maps.

1. [Choropleths with tidycensus](02_choropleth.html)

1. [Thematic Mapping](030_thematic_sf.html) with `ggplot2`, `geom_sf`, `tigris`, and `viridis`.  Additionally we show faceting mapping, and saving map images and files.  We also introduce `tmap` a full featured thematic mapping package.
