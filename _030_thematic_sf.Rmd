## Simple Features

The initial modules of *Mapping in R* introduce plotting latitude and longitude with an interactive map (`mapview`) and generating a choropleth (a thematic map) using `tidycensus.`  The focus of this module is to introduce other customized thematic map packages: `tmap`, `sf`, `ggplot2`.  

**The backbone of this type of mapping data manipulation is the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)** -- sf for simple features -- a modern tidyverse compatible package for encoding spatial vector data. `sf` is the successor to `sp`. Since `sf` is tidyverse compatible, among the advantages is the fact that you can see your numeric data in a more familiar (and easier-to-view) data frame .  

> The `sf` simple features package affords the R coder an easy and familiar method of **storing data** vectors and **shapefile** polygons in a **tidy data frame**.

In these *Thematic Mapping with Simple Features* sections, we introduce the `tmap` package first.  Through the the `tmap` package you will learn an easy-to-use package for building spatial distributions on geographic maps.  These maps are typically `.png` image files.  (.png files are easy to produce and share.)  In this section we'll also use the `tigris` package -- to gather Census shapefiles -- and store those shape objects in the Simple Features data structure.  (In the [*Chropleth* module](02_choropleth.html) we used `tidycensus` to gather census Geography shape objects, as well as to gather census data variables.)  `tigris` simply gathers the shapefile polygons.  Later we will join the polygon object to a data frame using `tmaptools`.  

Next, we'll use the `ggplot::geom_sf` function to create our mapping visualizations using the widely adopted ggplot2 syntax.

Later, in the *interactive thematic mapping* section, you will make a different interactive choropleth using `leaflet`.  This section is largely a repeat of the earlier choropleth module. The level of interactivity is sparse, but functional.  Interactivity demonstrates how you can generate maps which move beyond traditional 2D map-on-a-page images. Just know that this zoom-in/zoom-out interactivity feature is possible because we use `leaflet` to draw the map.  By extension, you can add many interactive features, e.g. pop-up windows.  This section is a good set-up for the last section which covers how to save maps as files.  

[Saving / sharing ouput files](01_georeference.html#save_the_map).  Even interactive maps can be shared and distributed.  You can share maps either on the web, as an HTML file.


## Converting between `sf` and `sp`

`sf` is developed by the same [person](https://github.com/edzer)/people who developed `sp`.  `sf` is the modern approach.  However, if you need to convert between the two formats, it's easy!
