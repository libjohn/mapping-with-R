In this case we use the sf::st_geometry() function to plot only the geometry. You can quickly generate a faceted map by excluding the st_geometry function: e.g. plot(us_geo) but that will consume computation cycles (i.e. wait time). Therefore, I recommend trying the smaller layer for now.\n\nNote: Census geography for the USA will span the globe in part becuase Region 9 includes a multitude of pacific islands. Later we will limit to simply the “lower 48” states.\n\n\nplot(st_geometry(us_geo))"
