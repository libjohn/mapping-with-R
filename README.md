# README

Learning materials for the *Mapping with R* workshop, part of the [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/) learning series hosted by the [Data & Visualization Services](https://library.duke.edu/data/) Department.

The objective of this workshop is to introduce practical georeferencing (lat/long plotting) and thematic mapping.  The principle library packages used will be:  leaflet, tidycensus, sf, tmap, and ggmap


## Outline
1. Georeferencing with lat/lon points and leaflet
1. Choropleth with TidyCensus
1. Interactive Thematic Mapping with Simple Features
