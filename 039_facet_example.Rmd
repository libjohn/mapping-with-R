![](facet_map.png)

Ignoring the data wrangling, the faceted map above was created with the following simplified code.  See also the [full code](038_facets_wrap_thematic_mapping.html) including wrangling and workflow.

```{}
sf_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = wages, color = wages)) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 5070, datum = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  facet_wrap(~ category, 
             nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
```
